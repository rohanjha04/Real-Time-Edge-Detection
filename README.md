Equalisation not helping

What is Histogram Equalization?
It‚Äôs a technique to improve the contrast of an image.
It spreads out the most frequent pixel intensities, making dark areas brighter and bright areas darker ‚Äî resulting in more detail in both.
But traditional histogram equalization works on the entire image, and that can lead to:

Over-amplification of noise
Unrealistic lighting
‚ö°Ô∏è What is CLAHE?
CLAHE is a smarter version that:

Divides the image into small tiles (in our case, 8√ó8 regions),
Applies histogram equalization independently to each tile,
Then blends the tiles together using bilinear interpolation (so you don't see tile borders),
And limits contrast amplification using clipLimit to avoid over-enhancing noise.
üîß Parameters Explained:
clipLimit=2.0

Controls how much contrast enhancement happens.
Higher values = more contrast, but may also bring out noise.
Typical range: 1.0 to 4.0
2.0 is a safe, balanced value.
tileGridSize=(8, 8)

Image is divided into 8√ó8 tiles (or regions).
Smaller tiles ‚Üí more localized contrast adjustment (good for uneven lighting).
Larger tiles ‚Üí more global adjustment (like traditional histogram equalization).
